# Reading Buddy Privacy Policy

## Information We Collect

Reading Buddy collects and processes the following limited information:

- **Claude API Key:** We store your Claude API key locally in your browser's storage to authenticate requests to the Claude AI service. This key is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties other than Anthropic (the provider of Claude AI).
- **Selected Text:** When you select text to analyze, that text is temporarily processed and sent to Claude AI for analysis. The text and analysis results are stored only in your browser's local storage and are not transmitted to our servers.
- **Translation Results:** The results of text analysis are stored locally in your browser for your convenience, so you can refer back to previous analyses without reprocessing the text.

## How We Use Information

The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:
- To authenticate your requests to the Claude AI service
- To process and analyze the text you select
- To display analysis results in the extension interface
- To save your previous analyses for your convenience

## Data Storage and Security

All data collected by Reading Buddy is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. We do not maintain any servers that store your data, and we do not transmit your data to any third parties except for the text you choose to analyze, which is sent to Anthropic's Claude AI service.

Your Claude API key is stored securely in your browser's local storage and is only used to authenticate requests to the Claude AI service.

## Third-Party Services
